    Howdy. My name is Alex Sullivan. I'm a human being. I do fun stuff like breathe
    and ocasionally drink water. I've been known to consume nutrients from time to
    time. My sneaky secret is that I do it basically every day!

    I've been known to ocasionally black out around 10pm. Sometimes closer to 12am.
    Sometimes as early as 6pm! 

    I ocasionally take a train to go places. Ocasionally I take a bus. Sometimes but
    not too often I take a car as well.

    I sometimes go to a supermarket and buy a bunch of food. Ocasionally I'll cook
    it afterwards. I'll often just forget about it and throw it away though.

    I like to write about programming and politics and economics. I do stuff outside
    of blogging but...I mean who cares, right?
