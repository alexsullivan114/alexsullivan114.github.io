I'd typically describe myself as an anxious person. It has enough of an affect
on my life that I should really talk to a therapist about it.

Anxiety has a lot of different manifestations in my life - one of the more
reliably severe instances of anxiety that I have typically gotten is during job
interviews. It ends up creating a viscous cycle where I'm anxious about the
interview, the anxiety ends up harming my performance, and I become anxious
about being anxious about the interview and so on recursively.

At one point, and I don't know how this happened, I realized that the way to
overcome this cycle (at least in job interviews) was to just stop thinking about
the results of the interview _during_ the actual interview. Much easier said
than done, but while I was interviewing at Reddit that fact kind of clicked. As
a result, interviews started taking on a new flavor where instead of being in
this dreadful anxiety cycle I was instead just doing a _thing_ - programming or
talking about culture and so on. And I do _things_ all the time so who really
cares.

It's worked quite well - I find I do much better in interviews these days and
have less (albeit still substantial) anxiety about them.

That revelation made me start to examine why it was that just not thinking about
something reduced my anxiety so much. And I realized that, at least for me, I
generate a huge amount of anxiety by constantly replaying thoughts or worries in
my head. I instinctually assumed that I was replaying those thoughts and worries
*because* I was anxious, but the more I examine it the more I realize that it
really is the other way around. I bring a thought up in my head, that thought
produces some anxiety, and like a scab that you just can't stop picking I keep
going over it over and over again so the thought is just constantly present,
which means the anxiety associated with that thought is constantly present.

Then when I consciously decide to drop the thought, the anxiety (quite quickly
actually) fades away. The hard part for me is trying to work my way out of the
pattern of constantly bringing the thought up.
